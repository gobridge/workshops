This course consists of a series of video lectures by the University Professor in Computer Science Todd McLeod. It is a first semester university level programming course and it contains over 20 hours of content that will help you understand why the Go programming language is the best language you can learn today. It will also help you acquire additional valuable programming skills including understanding environment variables, using a command line interface (CLI) terminal, understanding SHA-1 checksums, working with GitHub, and increasing your productivity with an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Webstorm or Atom.io. This course provides options for multiple workshop sessions, each focusing on a separate set of topics.

Once a workshop for this course is scheduled, the teachers will be given a code to access the course for free.

Note: If you take this course, please also leave Todd a review as a thank you for creating this course for everyone. This will help other students find this course.

### Learn How To Code Google's Go (golang) Programming Language
More details: [Go for Complete Beginners](https://github.com/Pisush/go_for_complete_beginners)


This course designed for complete beginners, and in the end the students will have a local server that consumes a weather API.
The recommended format is a session of 6 meetings, 3 hours each, meeting every other week. A good instructors/students ratio would be 1:4. Between the classes the instructors would ideally be available on the Gophers slack occasionally to answer questions. The content is an adjustment of [How I Start](https://howistart.org/posts/go/1) to be complete-beginner friendly, with the kind permission of [Peter Bourgon](https://peter.bourgon.org/). 


Students will do well who:

1) Have no programming experience
- You never coded before
- You are not familiar with programming concepts
